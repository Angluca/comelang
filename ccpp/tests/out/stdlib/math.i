 */

/*
 * Facilities below assist adoption of -Wunsafe-buffer-usage, an off-by-default
 * Clang compiler warning that helps the developer minimize unsafe, raw
 * buffer manipulation in the code that may lead to buffer overflow
 * vulnerabilities.
 *
 * They are primarily designed for modern C++ code where -Wunsafe-buffer-usage
 * comes with automatic fix-it hints that help the developer transform
 * their code to use modern C++ containers, which may be made bounds-safe by
 * linking against a version of the C++ standard library that offers
 * bounds-checked containers.
 * They can be used in plain C, but -fbounds-safety is the preferred solution
 * for plain C (see also <ptrcheck.h>).
 *
 * Attribute __unsafe_buffer_usage can be used to label functions that should be
 * avoided as they may perform or otherwise introduce unsafe buffer
 * manipulation operations.
 *
 * Calls to such functions are flagged by -Wunsafe-buffer-usage, similarly to
 * how unchecked buffer manipulation operations are flagged when observed
 * by the compiler directly:
 *
 *   // An unsafe function that needs to be avoided.
 *   __unsafe_buffer_usage
 *   void foo(int *buf, size_t size);
 *
 *   // A safe alternative to foo().
 *   void foo(std::span<int> buf);
 *
 *   void bar(size_t idx) {
 *       int array[5];
 *
 *       // Direct unsafe buffer manipulation through subscript operator:
 *       array[idx] = 3;  // warning [-Wunsafe-buffer-usage]
 *       // Unsafe buffer manipulation through function foo():
 *       foo(array, 5);   // warning [-Wunsafe-buffer-usage]
 *       // Checked buffer manipulation, with bounds information automatically
 *       // preserved for the purposes of runtime checks in standard library:
 *       foo(array);      // no warning
 *   }
 *
 * While annotating a function as __unsafe_buffer_usage has an effect similar
 * to annotating it as __attribute__((__deprecated__)), the __unsafe_buffer_usage attribute
 * should be used whenever the resulting warning needs to be controlled
 * by the -Wunsafe-buffer-usage flag (which is turned off in codebases that
 * don't attempt to achieve bounds safety this way) as opposed to -Wdeprecated
 * (enabled in most codebases).
 *
 * The attribute does NOT suppress -Wunsafe-buffer-usage warnings inside
 * the function's body; it simply introduces new warnings at each call site
 * to help the developers avoid the function entirely. Most of the time
 * it does not make sense to annotate a function as __unsafe_buffer_usage
 * without providing the users with a safe alternative.
 *
 * Pragmas __unsafe_buffer_usage_begin and __unsafe_buffer_usage_end
 * annotate a range of code as intentionally containing unsafe buffer
 * operations. They suppress -Wunsafe-buffer-usage warnings
 * for unsafe operations in range:
 *
 *   __unsafe_buffer_usage_begin
 *   array[idx] = 3; // warning suppressed
 *   foo(array, 5);  // warning suppressed
 *   __unsafe_buffer_usage_end
 *
 * These pragmas are NOT a way to mass-annotate functions with the attribute
 * __unsafe_buffer_usage. Functions declared within the pragma range
 * do NOT get annotated automatically. In some rare situations it makes sense
 * to do all three: put the attribute on the function, put pragmas inside
 * the body of the function, and put pragmas around some call sites.

/*
 * COMPILATION ENVIRONMENTS -- see compat(5) for additional detail
 *
 * DEFAULT	By default newly complied code will get POSIX APIs plus
 *		Apple API extensions in scope.
 *
 *		Most users will use this compilation environment to avoid
 *		behavioral differences between 32 and 64 bit code.
 *
 * LEGACY	Defining _NONSTD_SOURCE will get pre-POSIX APIs plus Apple
 *		API extensions in scope.
 *
 *		This is generally equivalent to the Tiger release compilation
 *		environment, except that it cannot be applied to 64 bit code;
 *		its use is discouraged.
 *
 *		We expect this environment to be deprecated in the future.
 *
 * STRICT	Defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE restricts the
 *		available APIs to exactly the set of APIs defined by the
 *		corresponding standard, based on the value defined.
 *
 *		A correct, portable definition for _POSIX_C_SOURCE is 200112L.
 *		A correct, portable definition for _XOPEN_SOURCE is 600L.
 *
 *		Apple API extensions are not visible in this environment,
 *		which can cause Apple specific code to fail to compile,
 *		or behave incorrectly if prototypes are not in scope or
 *		warnings about missing prototypes are not enabled or ignored.
 *
 * In any compilation environment, for correct symbol resolution to occur,
 * function prototypes must be in scope.  It is recommended that all Apple
 * tools users add either the "-Wall" or "-Wimplicit-function-declaration"
 * compiler flags to their projects to be warned when a function is being
 * used without a prototype in scope.
 */

/* These settings are particular to each product. */
/* Platform: MacOSX */

/*
 * The __DARWIN_ALIAS macros are used to do symbol renaming; they allow
 * legacy code to use the old symbol, thus maintaining binary compatibility
 * while new code can use a standards compliant version of the same function.
 *
 * __DARWIN_ALIAS is used by itself if the function signature has not
 * changed, it is used along with a #ifdef check for __DARWIN_UNIX03
 * if the signature has changed.  Because the 1 environment
 * only supports UNIX03 semantics it causes __DARWIN_UNIX03 to be
 * defined, but causes __DARWIN_ALIAS to do no symbol mangling.
 *
 * As a special case, when XCode is used to target a specific version of the
 * OS, the manifest constant __ENVIRONMENT_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED__
 * will be defined by the compiler, with the digits representing major version
 * time 100 + minor version times 10 (__unreachable_ok_pop 	 _Pragma("clang diagnostic pop").g. 10.5 := 1050).  If we are targeting
 * pre-10.5, and it is the default compilation environment, revert the
 * compilation environment to pre-__DARWIN_UNIX03.

 /*     
    These macros are for use in OS header files. They enable function prototypes
    and Objective-C methods to be tagged with the OS version in which they
    were first available; and, if applicable, the OS versions in which they
    became deprecated and obsoleted.
     
    The desktop Mac OS X and iOS each have different version numbers.
    The __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING() macro allows you to specify both the desktop
    and iOS version numbers.  For instance:
        __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_2,__IPHONE_2_0)
    means the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.2 on the desktop
    and first available in iOS 2.0 on the iPhone.
    
    If a function is available on one platform, but not the other a _NA (not
    applicable) parameter is used.  For instance:
            __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_3,__IPHONE_NA)
    means that the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.3, and it
    currently not implemented on the iPhone.

    At some point, a function/method may be deprecated.  That means Apple
    recommends applications stop using the function, either because there is a 
    better replacement or the functionality is being phased out.  Deprecated
    functions/methods can be tagged with a __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED()
    macro which specifies the OS version where the function became available
    as well as the OS version in which it became deprecated.  For instance:
        __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED(__MAC_10_0,__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA,__IPHONE_NA)
    means that the function/method was introduced in Mac OS X 10.0, then
    became deprecated beginning in Mac OS X 10.5.  On iOS the function 
    has never been available.  
    
    For these macros to function properly, a program must specify the OS version range 
    it is targeting.  The min OS version is specified as an option to the compiler:
    -mmacosx-version-min=10.x when building for Mac OS X, and -miphoneos-version-min=y.z
    when building for the iPhone.  The upper bound for the OS version is rarely needed,
    but it can be set on the command line via: -D__MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED=10x0 for
    Mac OS X and __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED = y0z00 for iOS.  
    
    Examples:

        A function available in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, but not on the phone:
        
            extern void mymacfunc() __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA);


        An Objective-C method in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, but not on the phone:
        
            @interface MyClass : NSObject
            -(void) mymacmethod __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA);
            @end

        
        An enum available on the phone, but not available on Mac OS X:
        
           Note: this works when targeting the Mac OS X platform because 
           __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED is undefined which evaluates to zero. 
        

        An enum with values added in different iPhoneOS versions:
		
			enum {
			    myX  = 1,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 2.1 and later
			    myY  = 2,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 3.0 and later
			    myZ  = 3,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 3.0 and later
				...
		      Note: you do not want to use #if with enumeration values
			  when a client needs to see all values at compile time
			  and use runtime logic to only use the viable values.
			  

    It is also possible to use the *_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED in source code to make one
    source base that can be compiled to target a range of OS versions.  It is best
    to not use the _MAC_* and __IPHONE_* macros for comparisons, but rather their values.
    That is because you might get compiled on an old OS that does not __DARWIN_64_BIT_INO_T 1 a later
    OS version macro, and in the C preprocessor undefined values evaluate to zero
    in expresssions, which could cause the #if expression to evaluate in an unexpected
    way.

/*  These inline functions may fail to return expected results if unsafe
    math optimizations like those enabled by -ffast-math are turned on.
    Thus, (somewhat surprisingly) you only get the fast inline
    implementations if such compiler options are NOT enabled.  This is
    because the inline functions require the compiler to be adhering to
    the standard in order to work properly; -ffast-math, among other
    things, implies that NaNs don't happen, which allows the compiler to
    optimize away checks like x != x, which might lead to things like
