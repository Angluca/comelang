 */

/* __used forces variables and functions to be included even if it appears

 */

/* __cold marks code used for debugging or that is rarely taken
 * and tells the compiler to optimize for size and outline code.
 */

/* __returns_nonnull marks functions that return a non-null pointer. */

/* __exported denotes symbols that should be exported even when symbols

 * __exported_push/_exported_pop are pragmas used to delimit a range of

/* __deprecated causes the compiler to produce a warning when encountering

 * This may require turning on such warning with the -Wdeprecated flag.
 * __deprecated_enum_msg() should be used on enums, and compilers that support
 * it will print the deprecation warning.
 * __kpi_deprecated() specifically indicates deprecation of kernel programming

 */

/*
 * Facilities below assist adoption of -Wunsafe-buffer-usage, an off-by-default
 * Clang compiler warning that helps the developer minimize unsafe, raw
 * buffer manipulation in the code that may lead to buffer overflow
 * vulnerabilities.
 *
 * They are primarily designed for modern C++ code where -Wunsafe-buffer-usage
 * comes with automatic fix-it hints that help the developer transform
 * their code to use modern C++ containers, which may be made bounds-safe by
 * linking against a version of the C++ standard library that offers
 * bounds-checked containers.
 * They can be used in plain C, but -fbounds-safety is the preferred solution
 * for plain C (see also <ptrcheck.h>).
 *
 * Attribute __unsafe_buffer_usage can be used to label functions that should be
 * avoided as they may perform or otherwise introduce unsafe buffer
 * manipulation operations.
 *
 * Calls to such functions are flagged by -Wunsafe-buffer-usage, similarly to
 * how unchecked buffer manipulation operations are flagged when observed
 * by the compiler directly:
 *
 *   // An unsafe function that needs to be avoided.
 *   __unsafe_buffer_usage
 *   void foo(int *buf, size_t size);
 *
 *   // A safe alternative to foo().
 *   void foo(std::span<int> buf);
 *
 *   void bar(size_t idx) {
 *       int array[5];
 *
 *       // Direct unsafe buffer manipulation through subscript operator:
 *       array[idx] = 3;  // warning [-Wunsafe-buffer-usage]
 *       // Unsafe buffer manipulation through function foo():
 *       foo(array, 5);   // warning [-Wunsafe-buffer-usage]
 *       // Checked buffer manipulation, with bounds information automatically
 *       // preserved for the purposes of runtime checks in standard library:
 *       foo(array);      // no warning
 *   }
 *
 * While annotating a function as __unsafe_buffer_usage has an effect similar
 * to annotating it as __attribute__((__deprecated__)), the __unsafe_buffer_usage attribute
 * should be used whenever the resulting warning needs to be controlled
 * by the -Wunsafe-buffer-usage flag (which is turned off in codebases that
 * don't attempt to achieve bounds safety this way) as opposed to -Wdeprecated
 * (enabled in most codebases).
 *
 * The attribute does NOT suppress -Wunsafe-buffer-usage warnings inside
 * the function's body; it simply introduces new warnings at each call site
 * to help the developers avoid the function entirely. Most of the time
 * it does not make sense to annotate a function as __unsafe_buffer_usage
 * without providing the users with a safe alternative.
 *
 * Pragmas __unsafe_buffer_usage_begin and __unsafe_buffer_usage_end
 * annotate a range of code as intentionally containing unsafe buffer
 * operations. They suppress -Wunsafe-buffer-usage warnings
 * for unsafe operations in range:
 *
 *   __unsafe_buffer_usage_begin
 *   array[idx] = 3; // warning suppressed
 *   foo(array, 5);  // warning suppressed
 *   __unsafe_buffer_usage_end
 *
 * These pragmas are NOT a way to mass-annotate functions with the attribute
 * __unsafe_buffer_usage. Functions declared within the pragma range
 * do NOT get annotated automatically. In some rare situations it makes sense
 * to do all three: put the attribute on the function, put pragmas inside
 * the body of the function, and put pragmas around some call sites.

/*
 * COMPILATION ENVIRONMENTS -- see compat(5) for additional detail
 *
 * DEFAULT	By default newly complied code will get POSIX APIs plus
 *		Apple API extensions in scope.
 *
 *		Most users will use this compilation environment to avoid
 *		behavioral differences between 32 and 64 bit code.
 *
 * LEGACY	Defining _NONSTD_SOURCE will get pre-POSIX APIs plus Apple
 *		API extensions in scope.
 *
 *		This is generally equivalent to the Tiger release compilation
 *		environment, except that it cannot be applied to 64 bit code;
 *		its use is discouraged.
 *
 *		We expect this environment to be deprecated in the future.
 *
 * STRICT	Defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE restricts the
 *		available APIs to exactly the set of APIs defined by the
 *		corresponding standard, based on the value defined.
 *
 *		A correct, portable definition for _POSIX_C_SOURCE is 200112L.
 *		A correct, portable definition for _XOPEN_SOURCE is 600L.
 *
 *		Apple API extensions are not visible in this environment,
 *		which can cause Apple specific code to fail to compile,
 *		or behave incorrectly if prototypes are not in scope or
 *		warnings about missing prototypes are not enabled or ignored.
 *
 * In any compilation environment, for correct symbol resolution to occur,
 * function prototypes must be in scope.  It is recommended that all Apple
 * tools users add either the "-Wall" or "-Wimplicit-function-declaration"
 * compiler flags to their projects to be warned when a function is being
 * used without a prototype in scope.
 */

/* These settings are particular to each product. */
/* Platform: MacOSX */

/*
 * The __DARWIN_ALIAS macros are used to do symbol renaming; they allow
 * legacy code to use the old symbol, thus maintaining binary compatibility
 * while new code can use a standards compliant version of the same function.
 *
 * __DARWIN_ALIAS is used by itself if the function signature has not
 * changed, it is used along with a #ifdef check for __DARWIN_UNIX03
 * if the signature has changed.  Because the 1 environment
 * only supports UNIX03 semantics it causes __DARWIN_UNIX03 to be
 * defined, but causes __DARWIN_ALIAS to do no symbol mangling.
 *
 * As a special case, when XCode is used to target a specific version of the
 * OS, the manifest constant __ENVIRONMENT_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED__
 * will be defined by the compiler, with the digits representing major version
 * time 100 + minor version times 10 (__unreachable_ok_pop 	 _Pragma("clang diagnostic pop").g. 10.5 := 1050).  If we are targeting
 * pre-10.5, and it is the default compilation environment, revert the
 * compilation environment to pre-__DARWIN_UNIX03.

 * The rune type below is declared to be an ``int'' instead of the more natural
 * ``unsigned long'' or ``long''.  Two things are happening here.  It is not
 * unsigned so that EOF (-1) can be naturally assigned to it and used.  Also,
 * it looks like 10646 will be a 31 bit standard.  This means that if your
 * ints cannot hold 32 bits, you will be in trouble.  The reason an int was
 * chosen over a long is that the is*() and to*() routines take ints (says
 * ANSI C), but they use __darwin_ct_rune_t instead of int.  By changing it
 * here, you lose a bit of ANSI conformance, but your programs will still
 * work.
 *
 * NOTE: rune_t is not covered by ANSI nor other standards, and should not
 * be instantiated outside of lib/libc/locale.  Use wchar_t.  wchar_t and
 * rune_t must be the same type.  Also wint_t must be no narrower than
 * wchar_t, and should also be able to hold all members of the largest
 * character set plus one extra value (WEOF). wint_t must be at least 16 bits.

 /*     
    These macros are for use in OS header files. They enable function prototypes
    and Objective-C methods to be tagged with the OS version in which they
    were first available; and, if applicable, the OS versions in which they
    became deprecated and obsoleted.
     
    The desktop Mac OS X and iOS each have different version numbers.
    The __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING() macro allows you to specify both the desktop
    and iOS version numbers.  For instance:
        __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_2,__IPHONE_2_0)
    means the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.2 on the desktop
    and first available in iOS 2.0 on the iPhone.
    
    If a function is available on one platform, but not the other a _NA (not
    applicable) parameter is used.  For instance:
            __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_3,__IPHONE_NA)
    means that the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.3, and it
    currently not implemented on the iPhone.

    At some point, a function/method may be deprecated.  That means Apple
    recommends applications stop using the function, either because there is a 
    better replacement or the functionality is being phased out.  Deprecated
    functions/methods can be tagged with a __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED()
    macro which specifies the OS version where the function became available
    as well as the OS version in which it became deprecated.  For instance:
        __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED(__MAC_10_0,__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA,__IPHONE_NA)
    means that the function/method was introduced in Mac OS X 10.0, then
    became deprecated beginning in Mac OS X 10.5.  On iOS the function 
    has never been available.  
    
    For these macros to function properly, a program must specify the OS version range 
    it is targeting.  The min OS version is specified as an option to the compiler:
    -mmacosx-version-min=10.x when building for Mac OS X, and -miphoneos-version-min=y.z
    when building for the iPhone.  The upper bound for the OS version is rarely needed,
    but it can be set on the command line via: -D__MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED=10x0 for
    Mac OS X and __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED = y0z00 for iOS.  
    
    Examples:

        A function available in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, but not on the phone:
        
            extern void mymacfunc() __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA);


        An Objective-C method in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, but not on the phone:
        
            @interface MyClass : NSObject
            -(void) mymacmethod __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA);
            @end

        
        An enum available on the phone, but not available on Mac OS X:
        
           Note: this works when targeting the Mac OS X platform because 
           __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED is undefined which evaluates to zero. 
        

        An enum with values added in different iPhoneOS versions:
		
			enum {
			    myX  = 1,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 2.1 and later
			    myY  = 2,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 3.0 and later
			    myZ  = 3,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 3.0 and later
				...
		      Note: you do not want to use #if with enumeration values
			  when a client needs to see all values at compile time
			  and use runtime logic to only use the viable values.
			  

    It is also possible to use the *_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED in source code to make one
    source base that can be compiled to target a range of OS versions.  It is best
    to not use the _MAC_* and __IPHONE_* macros for comparisons, but rather their values.
    That is because you might get compiled on an old OS that does not __DARWIN_64_BIT_INO_T 1 a later
    OS version macro, and in the C preprocessor undefined values evaluate to zero
    in expresssions, which could cause the #if expression to evaluate in an unexpected
    way.

/* 
 * __API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED is used as a version number in API that will be deprecated

 * deprecation to notify developers about the API before compiler warnings are generated.
 * You can find all places in your code that use soft deprecated API by redefining the 
 * value of this macro to your current minimum deployment target, for example:
 * (macOS)
 *   clang -D__API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED=10.12 <other compiler flags>
 * (iOS)
 *   clang -D__API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED=11.0 <other compiler flags>
