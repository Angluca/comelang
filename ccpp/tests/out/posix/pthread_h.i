 * The __CONCAT macro is a bit tricky -- make sure you don't put spaces

 * arguments (meaning they can't dereference pointers).
 *
 * __stateful_pure can be used for functions that have no side effects,
 * but depend on the state of the memory.
 */

/* __unused denotes variables and functions that may not be used, preventing
 * the compiler from warning about it if not used.
 */

/* __used forces variables and functions to be included even if it appears
 * to the compiler that they are not used (and would thust be discarded).
 */

/* __cold marks code used for debugging or that is rarely taken
 * and tells the compiler to optimize for size and outline code.
 */

/* __returns_nonnull marks functions that return a non-null pointer. */

/* __exported denotes symbols that should be exported even when symbols
 * are hidden by default.
 * __exported_push/_exported_pop are pragmas used to delimit a range of

/* __deprecated causes the compiler to produce a warning when encountering

 * This may require turning on such warning with the -Wdeprecated flag.
 * __deprecated_enum_msg() should be used on enums, and compilers that support
 * it will print the deprecation warning.
 * __kpi_deprecated() specifically indicates deprecation of kernel programming
 * interfaces in Kernel.framework used by KEXTs.

/*
 * __alloc_size can be used to label function arguments that represent the

 *
 * void	*malloc(size_t __size) __alloc_size(1);
 *

 */

/*
 * Facilities below assist adoption of -Wunsafe-buffer-usage, an off-by-default
 * Clang compiler warning that helps the developer minimize unsafe, raw
 * buffer manipulation in the code that may lead to buffer overflow
 * vulnerabilities.
 *
 * They are primarily designed for modern C++ code where -Wunsafe-buffer-usage
 * comes with automatic fix-it hints that help the developer transform
 * their code to use modern C++ containers, which may be made bounds-safe by
 * linking against a version of the C++ standard library that offers
 * bounds-checked containers.
 * They can be used in plain C, but -fbounds-safety is the preferred solution
 * for plain C (see also <ptrcheck.h>).
 *
 * Attribute __unsafe_buffer_usage can be used to label functions that should be
 * avoided as they may perform or otherwise introduce unsafe buffer
 * manipulation operations.
 *
 * Calls to such functions are flagged by -Wunsafe-buffer-usage, similarly to
 * how unchecked buffer manipulation operations are flagged when observed
 * by the compiler directly:
 *
 *   // An unsafe function that needs to be avoided.
 *   __unsafe_buffer_usage
 *   void foo(int *buf, size_t size);
 *
 *   // A safe alternative to foo().
 *   void foo(std::span<int> buf);
 *
 *   void bar(size_t idx) {
 *       int array[5];
 *
 *       // Direct unsafe buffer manipulation through subscript operator:
 *       array[idx] = 3;  // warning [-Wunsafe-buffer-usage]
 *       // Unsafe buffer manipulation through function foo():
 *       foo(array, 5);   // warning [-Wunsafe-buffer-usage]
 *       // Checked buffer manipulation, with bounds information automatically
 *       // preserved for the purposes of runtime checks in standard library:
 *       foo(array);      // no warning
 *   }
 *
 * While annotating a function as __unsafe_buffer_usage has an effect similar
 * to annotating it as __attribute__((__deprecated__)), the __unsafe_buffer_usage attribute
 * should be used whenever the resulting warning needs to be controlled
 * by the -Wunsafe-buffer-usage flag (which is turned off in codebases that
 * don't attempt to achieve bounds safety this way) as opposed to -Wdeprecated
 * (enabled in most codebases).
 *
 * The attribute does NOT suppress -Wunsafe-buffer-usage warnings inside
 * the function's body; it simply introduces new warnings at each call site
 * to help the developers avoid the function entirely. Most of the time
 * it does not make sense to annotate a function as __unsafe_buffer_usage
 * without providing the users with a safe alternative.
 *
 * Pragmas __unsafe_buffer_usage_begin and __unsafe_buffer_usage_end
 * annotate a range of code as intentionally containing unsafe buffer
 * operations. They suppress -Wunsafe-buffer-usage warnings
 * for unsafe operations in range:
 *
 *   __unsafe_buffer_usage_begin
 *   array[idx] = 3; // warning suppressed
 *   foo(array, 5);  // warning suppressed
 *   __unsafe_buffer_usage_end
 *
 * These pragmas are NOT a way to mass-annotate functions with the attribute
 * __unsafe_buffer_usage. Functions declared within the pragma range
 * do NOT get annotated automatically. In some rare situations it makes sense
 * to do all three: put the attribute on the function, put pragmas inside
 * the body of the function, and put pragmas around some call sites.

/*
 * COMPILATION ENVIRONMENTS -- see compat(5) for additional detail
 *
 * DEFAULT	By default newly complied code will get POSIX APIs plus
 *		Apple API extensions in scope.
 *
 *		Most users will use this compilation environment to avoid
 *		behavioral differences between 32 and 64 bit code.
 *
 * LEGACY	Defining _NONSTD_SOURCE will get pre-POSIX APIs plus Apple
 *		API extensions in scope.
 *
 *		This is generally equivalent to the Tiger release compilation
 *		environment, except that it cannot be applied to 64 bit code;
 *		its use is discouraged.
 *
 *		We expect this environment to be deprecated in the future.
 *
 * STRICT	Defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE restricts the
 *		available APIs to exactly the set of APIs defined by the
 *		corresponding standard, based on the value defined.
 *
 *		A correct, portable definition for _POSIX_C_SOURCE is 200112L.
 *		A correct, portable definition for _XOPEN_SOURCE is 600L.
 *
 *		Apple API extensions are not visible in this environment,
 *		which can cause Apple specific code to fail to compile,
 *		or behave incorrectly if prototypes are not in scope or
 *		warnings about missing prototypes are not enabled or ignored.
 *
 * In any compilation environment, for correct symbol resolution to occur,
 * function prototypes must be in scope.  It is recommended that all Apple
 * tools users add either the "-Wall" or "-Wimplicit-function-declaration"
 * compiler flags to their projects to be warned when a function is being
 * used without a prototype in scope.
 */

/* These settings are particular to each product. */
/* Platform: MacOSX */

/*
 * The __DARWIN_ALIAS macros are used to do symbol renaming; they allow
 * legacy code to use the old symbol, thus maintaining binary compatibility
 * while new code can use a standards compliant version of the same function.
 *
 * __DARWIN_ALIAS is used by itself if the function signature has not
 * changed, it is used along with a #ifdef check for __DARWIN_UNIX03
 * if the signature has changed.  Because the 1 environment
 * only supports UNIX03 semantics it causes __DARWIN_UNIX03 to be
 * defined, but causes __DARWIN_ALIAS to do no symbol mangling.
 *
 * As a special case, when XCode is used to target a specific version of the
 * OS, the manifest constant __ENVIRONMENT_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED__
 * will be defined by the compiler, with the digits representing major version
 * time 100 + minor version times 10 (__unreachable_ok_pop 	 _Pragma("clang diagnostic pop").g. 10.5 := 1050).  If we are targeting
 * pre-10.5, and it is the default compilation environment, revert the
 * compilation environment to pre-__DARWIN_UNIX03.

 * it looks like 10646 will be a 31 bit standard.  This means that if your
 * ints cannot hold 32 bits, you will be in trouble.  The reason an int was
 * chosen over a long is that the is*() and to*() routines take ints (says
 * ANSI C), but they use __darwin_ct_rune_t instead of int.  By changing it
 * here, you lose a bit of ANSI conformance, but your programs will still
 * work.
 *
 * NOTE: rune_t is not covered by ANSI nor other standards, and should not
 * be instantiated outside of lib/libc/locale.  Use wchar_t.  wchar_t and
 * rune_t must be the same type.  Also wint_t must be no narrower than
 * wchar_t, and should also be able to hold all members of the largest
 * character set plus one extra value (WEOF). wint_t must be at least 16 bits.

 /*     
    These macros are for use in OS header files. They enable function prototypes
    and Objective-C methods to be tagged with the OS version in which they
    were first available; and, if applicable, the OS versions in which they
    became deprecated and obsoleted.
     
    The desktop Mac OS X and iOS each have different version numbers.
    The __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING() macro allows you to specify both the desktop
    and iOS version numbers.  For instance:
        __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_2,__IPHONE_2_0)
    means the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.2 on the desktop
    and first available in iOS 2.0 on the iPhone.
    
    If a function is available on one platform, but not the other a _NA (not
    applicable) parameter is used.  For instance:
            __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_3,__IPHONE_NA)
    means that the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.3, and it
    currently not implemented on the iPhone.

    At some point, a function/method may be deprecated.  That means Apple
    recommends applications stop using the function, either because there is a 
    better replacement or the functionality is being phased out.  Deprecated
    functions/methods can be tagged with a __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED()
    macro which specifies the OS version where the function became available
    as well as the OS version in which it became deprecated.  For instance:
        __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED(__MAC_10_0,__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA,__IPHONE_NA)
    means that the function/method was introduced in Mac OS X 10.0, then
    became deprecated beginning in Mac OS X 10.5.  On iOS the function 
    has never been available.  
    
    For these macros to function properly, a program must specify the OS version range 
    it is targeting.  The min OS version is specified as an option to the compiler:
    -mmacosx-version-min=10.x when building for Mac OS X, and -miphoneos-version-min=y.z
    when building for the iPhone.  The upper bound for the OS version is rarely needed,
    but it can be set on the command line via: -D__MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED=10x0 for
    Mac OS X and __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED = y0z00 for iOS.  
    
    Examples:

        A function available in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, but not on the phone:
        
            extern void mymacfunc() __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA);


        An Objective-C method in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, but not on the phone:
        
            @interface MyClass : NSObject
            -(void) mymacmethod __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA);
            @end

        
        An enum available on the phone, but not available on Mac OS X:
        
           Note: this works when targeting the Mac OS X platform because 
           __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED is undefined which evaluates to zero. 
        

        An enum with values added in different iPhoneOS versions:
		
			enum {
			    myX  = 1,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 2.1 and later
			    myY  = 2,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 3.0 and later
			    myZ  = 3,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 3.0 and later
				...
		      Note: you do not want to use #if with enumeration values
			  when a client needs to see all values at compile time
			  and use runtime logic to only use the viable values.
			  

    It is also possible to use the *_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED in source code to make one
    source base that can be compiled to target a range of OS versions.  It is best
    to not use the _MAC_* and __IPHONE_* macros for comparisons, but rather their values.
    That is because you might get compiled on an old OS that does not __DARWIN_64_BIT_INO_T 1 a later
    OS version macro, and in the C preprocessor undefined values evaluate to zero
    in expresssions, which could cause the #if expression to evaluate in an unexpected
    way.

/* 
 * __API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED is used as a version number in API that will be deprecated 
 * in an upcoming release. This soft deprecation is an intermediate step before formal 
 * deprecation to notify developers about the API before compiler warnings are generated.
 * You can find all places in your code that use soft deprecated API by redefining the 
 * value of this macro to your current minimum deployment target, for example:
 * (macOS)
 *   clang -D__API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED=10.12 <other compiler flags>
 * (iOS)
 *   clang -D__API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED=11.0 <other compiler flags>

 * @typedef qos_class_t
 *
 * @abstract
 * An abstract thread quality of service (QOS) classification.
 *
 * @discussion
 * Thread quality of service (QOS) classes are ordered abstract representations
 * of the nature of work that is expected to be performed by a pthread, dispatch
 * queue, or NSOperation. Each class specifies a maximum thread scheduling
 * priority for that band (which may be used in combination with a relative
 * priority offset within the band), as well as quality of service
 * characteristics for timer latency, CPU throughput, I/O throughput, network
 * socket traffic management behavior and more.
 *
 * A best effort is made to allocate available system resources to every QOS
 * class. Quality of service degredation only occurs during system resource
 * contention, proportionally to the QOS class. That said, QOS classes
 * representing user-initiated work attempt to achieve peak throughput while
 * QOS classes for other work attempt to achieve peak energy and thermal
 * efficiency, even in the absence of contention. Finally, the use of QOS
 * classes does not allow threads to supersede any limits that may be applied
 * to the overall process.
 */

/*!
 * @constant QOS_CLASS_USER_INTERACTIVE
 * @abstract A QOS class which indicates work performed by this thread
 * is interactive with the user.
 * @discussion Such work is requested to run at high priority relative to other
 * work on the system. Specifying this QOS class is a request to run with
 * nearly all available system CPU and I/O bandwidth even under contention.
 * This is not an energy-efficient QOS class to use for large tasks. The use of
 * this QOS class should be limited to critical interaction with the user such
 * as handling events on the main event loop, view drawing, animation, etc.
 *
 * @constant QOS_CLASS_USER_INITIATED
 * @abstract A QOS class which indicates work performed by this thread
 * was initiated by the user and that the user is likely waiting for the
 * results.
 * @discussion Such work is requested to run at a priority below critical user-
 * interactive work, but relatively higher than other work on the system. This
 * is not an energy-efficient QOS class to use for large tasks. Its use
 * should be limited to operations of short enough duration that the user is
 * unlikely to switch tasks while waiting for the results. Typical
 * user-initiated work will have progress indicated by the display of
 * placeholder content or modal user interface.
 *
 * @constant QOS_CLASS_DEFAULT
 * @abstract A default QOS class used by the system in cases where more specific
 * QOS class information is not available.
 * @discussion Such work is requested to run at a priority below critical user-
 * interactive and user-initiated work, but relatively higher than utility and
 * background tasks. Threads created by pthread_create() without an attribute
 * specifying a QOS class will default to QOS_CLASS_DEFAULT. This QOS class
 * value is not intended to be used as a work classification, it should only be
 * set when propagating or restoring QOS class values provided by the system.
 *
 * @constant QOS_CLASS_UTILITY
 * @abstract A QOS class which indicates work performed by this thread
 * may or may not be initiated by the user and that the user is unlikely to be
 * immediately waiting for the results.
 * @discussion Such work is requested to run at a priority below critical user-
 * interactive and user-initiated work, but relatively higher than low-level
 * system maintenance tasks. The use of this QOS class indicates the work
 * should be run in an energy and thermally-efficient manner. The progress of
 * utility work may or may not be indicated to the user, but the effect of such
 * work is user-visible.
 *
 * @constant QOS_CLASS_BACKGROUND
 * @abstract A QOS class which indicates work performed by this thread was not
 * initiated by the user and that the user may be unaware of the results.
 * @discussion Such work is requested to run at a priority below other work.
 * The use of this QOS class indicates the work should be run in the most energy
 * and thermally-efficient manner.
 *
 * @constant QOS_CLASS_UNSPECIFIED
 * @abstract A QOS class value which indicates the absence or removal of QOS
 * class information.
 * @discussion As an API return value, may indicate that threads or pthread
 * attributes were configured with legacy API incompatible or in conflict with
 * the QOS class system.

/*!
 * @function pthread_jit_write_with_callback_np
 *
 * @abstract
 * Toggles per-thread write-protection of the MAP_JIT region to writeable,
 * invokes an allowed callback function to write to it, and toggles protection
 * back to executable.
 *
 * @param callback
 * The callback function to invoke to write to the MAP_JIT region.  It must be
 * statically allowed using {@link PTHREAD_JIT_WRITE_ALLOW_CALLBACKS_NP}.
 *
 * @param ctx
 * Context to pass through to the invocation of the callback function.
 *
 * @result
 * The result code returned by the callback function.
 *
 * @discussion
 * This function assumes that the MAP_JIT region has executable protection when
 * called.  It is therefore invalid to call it recursively from within a write
 * callback.  The implementation does not detect such invalid recursive calls,
 * so the client is responsible for preventing them.
 *
 * Callbacks _must not_ perform any non-local transfer of control flow (__API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED 100000.g.
 * throw an exception, longjmp(3)), as doing so would leave the MAP_JIT region
 * writeable.
 *
 * On systems where pthread_jit_write_protect_supported_np(3) is false, this
 * function calls @callback directly and does nothing else.
 *
 * This function only enforces that @callback is allowed if the caller has the
 * com.apple.security.cs.jit-write-allowlist entitlement.  That entitlement also
 * disallows use of pthread_jit_write_protect_np(3).  Adopting the entitlement
 * is therefore crucial in realizing the security benefits of this interface.
 *
 * If the entitlement is not present then this function toggles protection of
 * the MAP_JIT to writeable, calls @callback and then toggles protection back to
 * executable, without validating that @callback is an allowed function.  This
 * behavior is intended to permit independent adoption of this interface by
 * libraries - once all libraries in an application have adopted, the
 * application should add the entitlement.
 *
 * By default, only callbacks in libraries/images present at process start-up
 * are allowed - callbacks in images loaded dynamically via dlopen(3)/etc. are
 * not permitted.  However, if the additional entitlement
 * com.apple.security.cs.jit-write-allowlist-freeze-late is _also_ present, any
 * callbacks in dlopen'd libraries are also added to the set of allowed
 * callbacks until the {@link pthread_jit_write_freeze_callbacks_np} function is
 * called.
 *
 * The goal of this interface is to allow applications that execute JIT-compiled
 * code to mitigate against attempts from attackers to escalate to code
 * execution by getting their own instructions written to the MAP_JIT region.
 *
 * Callbacks should assume an attacker can control the input to this function.
 * They must therefore carefully validate the data that they are passed and do
 * so using as little attackable state as possible. This means simplifying
 * control flow and avoiding spills of sensitive registers (__API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED 100000.g. those used for
 * validation or control flow).

 *
 * @discussion
 * If the com.apple.security.cs.jit-write-allowlist-freeze-late entitlement is
 * present, this function must be called exactly once after all libraries
 * containing JIT write callbacks have been loaded to prevent any further
 * runtime modifications to the set of allowed callbacks.  Failing to call this
 * function before calling pthread_jit_write_with_callback_np(3) for the first
 * time is an error, as is calling it multiple times.
 *
 * If the jit-write-allowlist-freeze-late entitlement is not present, calling
 * this function is an error.
 *
 * If an application does not need to dlopen(3) any libraries or frameworks
 * containing needed JIT write callbacks, it is best to avoid the
 * jit-write-allowlist-freeze-late entitlement and accompanying need to call
 * this function, as this allows the runtime to automatically freeze the set of
 * allowed callbacks early in process initialization.
